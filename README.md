# twittermappingproject
The project will be mapping an interactive data visualization of crime that happens in Washington DC. The program will scrape Twitter code directly from the DC Police Twitter account. The program will be coded in Python with a visual library to better display the information. The project will combine multiple data science concepts such as data scraping, data cleaning, data transforming and data visualization all in the programming language of Python. This project will be helpful for anyone that may pass through the city to know of the dangers certain areas contain.
